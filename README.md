# Machine Learning in 6 weeks

## Overview

I built this project to actually understand what is happening behind the scenes for various identification programs. I started to learn machine learning fundamentals by implementing key algorithms using NumPy. I used Matplotlib to graph and visualize graphs.

## Why This?

Usually, most ML projects jump right into using libraries such as PyTorch or scikit-learn. I wanted to **actually understand** what is happening and what proccesses happenen when we talk about machine learning. This project displays my growth from zero knowledge in ML to making neural networks.

## Timeline

 - **Week 1 (Jan 17 - Jan 23):** Linear Regression
 - **Week 2 (Jan 24 - Jan 30):** Logistic Regression
 - **Week 3 (Jan 31 - Feb 6):** K-means Clustering
 - **Week 4 (Feb 7 - Feb 13):** Neural Networks
 - **Week 5 (Feb 14 - Feb 20):** PyTorch Comparison
 - **Week 6 (Feb 21 - Feb 27):** MNIST Challenge

## Background

High school sophomore interested in AI and the theory side of CS. This is my first deep project about machine learning.

## Technologies

- Python 3.14
- NumPy 
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- PyTorch (to compare at the end)

## Current Status

&emsp;**Completed** 
- Week 1 prep (learning linear algebra and statistics along with NumPy)
- Week 1: Linear Regression fitting using gradient descent using NumPy and matplotlib

&emsp;
**In Progress**

- Week 2 prep (learning sigmoid function and its properties using NumPy and matplotlib)

## Timeline Update 
**Original Schedule:** Week 2 scheduled for Jan 24 - 30 and Week 5 scheduled for Feb 14 - Feb 20
**Adjusted Schedule:** Week 2 postponed for Jan 31 - Feb 6. Rest of weeks pushed. Week 4 pushed one week after that such that Week 4 is Feb 21 - Feb 28and the rest are after that point for the next two weeks.

**Reason:** Science Olympiad Invitational (Jan 31 & Feb 21) requires extra preparation time in the weeks before the competition.

**Revised Timeline:**
- Week 1: Linear Regression (completed)
- Week 2: Logistic Regression (Jan 31 - Feb 6)
- Week 3: K-Means (Feb 7 - Feb 13)
- Week 4: Neural Networks (Feb 21 - Feb 27)
- Week 5: PyTorch (Feb 28 - Mar 6)
- Week 6: MNIST (Mar 7 - Mar 13)
